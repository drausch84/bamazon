# bamazon


This is a shopping application project that utilizes SQL and JS technology.  After creating a SQL database, which has been named bamazon, a table is created
which lists out a total of 10 products, each with specific id numbers, product names, department names, and stock quantities.  There are 2 different JS files that
can be run; a bamazonCustomer js file and a bamazonManager.js file.  The customer file is rather basic and allows a user to input a purchase of an item(although an error will run if that specific item is out of stock).  The manager file allows a user to have a list of all items for sale, view items with low stock quantities, adding stock quantity to existing items, as well as adding new products to the SQL database.
